You are a personal assistant. Analyze the following Chat History.

Recent Finished Tasks (Memory):
{{ memory_text }}

Chat Context:
{{ message_text }}

Task:
1. Context: The last message in the history is the "Trigger".
2. Memory Check:
   - DUPLICATES: If asking for the EXACT same thing as "Recent Finished Tasks" -> Priority 0, Action False.
   - LEARNING (Topics):
     - If the request is similar to "REJECTED Tasks" -> Priority 0, Action False.
     - If the request matches patterns in "ACCEPTED Tasks" -> High Priority.
   - LEARNING (People):
     - Check if the SENDER has a history of Rejected tasks in "REJECTED Tasks". If yes, be skeptical -> Priority < 5.
     - If SENDER is typically Accepted, trust them more.
3. Relevance: Is this conversation directing a task, question, or important information specifically to ME (the owner)?
   - If it's a general group chat noise, greetings ("hi", "hello"), or irrelevant chatter -> Priority 0, Action False.
   - If it's a specific request, deadline, or urgent info for me -> High Priority.
4. Rate urgency/importance from 0 to 10 (10 is critical, 0 is noise).
5. Summarize the request in one sentence.
6. Decide if action is required (True/False). Mark "False" for noise.
7. Extract a deadline if present (e.g., "by 5pm", "tomorrow", "Friday"). Return null if no deadline.

Output JSON only:
{
    "priority": <int>,
    "summary": "<string>",
    "action_required": <bool>,
    "deadline": "<string or null>"
}
